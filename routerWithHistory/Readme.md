# Simple Client-Side Routing with Node.js

This is a basic project that demonstrates client-side routing using plain JavaScript and a Node.js server. It serves an `index.html` file and uses JavaScript to manage routing within the browser.

## Features

- Basic client-side routing using JavaScript.
- A simple Node.js server that serves static files (`index.html`, `router.js`, etc.).
- Updates the URL path in the browser without reloading the page using `window.history.pushState`.
- Handles routes like `/home`, `/about`, `/contact`, and `/user/:id`.
- Default route (`/home`) serves the home page.
